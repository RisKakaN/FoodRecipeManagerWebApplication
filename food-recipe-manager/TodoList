=============================================== TODO ===============================================
1. Make ingredients list alphabetical order.

2. Make it possible to edit an ingredient. Currently you can only remove an ingredient, or add a completely new one.

3. Implement Favorites/Rating.


4. Improve filter feature: Make the filter design able to contain many different filters, and be easy to use and look good.
    - Use one button which opens many filters?
    - Dropdown?
    - Pop-up?
    - New page?

    - Filters to add:
        - Filter by alphabetical order. A-Z, Z-A.
        - Filter by rating. Highest. Lowest.
        - Filter by time. Shortest. Longest.


5. In profile page, add a box at top for showing stats? E.g. number of recipes, meat recipes, etc... 


7. Improve how instructions are being added and visualized. 
   Maybe introduce steps. Each step is one box of information, and so on.
   OR, maybe a textarea is good enough, since it free writing might be preferable...





- PROBLEMS:
    - Why is the UI in chrome-iphone not the same as in real-iphone. In real-iphone, the layout is messed up... In chrome-iphone, it looks perfect.



- NEW FEATURES/PAGES?
    - Shopping list.
    - Current ingredients at home.
    - Recipe finder based on ingredients (at home / or not).
