TODO:

- In profile page, add a box at top for showing stats? E.g. number of recipes, meat recipes, etc.... And add more as the features scale.

- Navigation bar should have hamburger menu when the window width gets too small to fit all buttons/text.

- Profile picture

- Make it possible to edit an ingredient's amount while viewing it (NOT EDIT MODE).
  In this way, if you only have 900g flour, you can make the rest of the ingredients proportional to your "900g of flour",
  instead of proportional to the portions. So, make it possible to edit the amount while viewing it.
  And this should not save it. Saving is done through editing the recipe.

- Improve how instructions are being added and visualized. 
  Maybe introduce steps. Each step is one box of information, and so on.

- Implement Favorites. OR rating? And add corresponding filters.

- Improve filters and add more. E.g. filter by time.

- NEW FEATURES/PAGES?
    - Shopping list.
    - Current ingredients at home.
    - Recipe finder based on ingredients (at home / or not).
